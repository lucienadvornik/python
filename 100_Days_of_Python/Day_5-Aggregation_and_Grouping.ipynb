    "# Day 5: Aggregation and Grouping with Multiple Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task:\n",
    "# You will work with a DataFrame containing employee information, similar to the previous tasks.\n",
    "# Your task is to perform more complex aggregations and grouping based on multiple criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here is the data you will work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "# | Name  | Age | Job              | Salary | Experience |\n",
    "# |-------|-----|------------------|--------|------------|\n",
    "# | John  | 28  | Programmer       | 58000  | 3          |\n",
    "# | Eva   | 34  | Analyst          | 64000  | 6          |\n",
    "# | Adam  | 30  | Data Scientist   | 72000  | 5          |\n",
    "# | Petra | 25  | Data Engineer    | 69000  | 4          |\n",
    "# | Mark  | 29  | Data Scientist   | 71000  | 4          |\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tasks:\n",
    "# 1. Load the DataFrame with the given data.\n",
    "# 2. Group the data by both the 'Job' and 'Experience' columns.\n",
    "# 3. For each group, calculate the average salary and the total number of employees.\n",
    "# 4. Print the resulting grouped DataFrame with these aggregated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tips:\n",
    "# - Use `groupby()` to group by multiple columns.\n",
    "# - Use `agg()` to apply multiple aggregation functions like 'mean' and 'count'.\n",
    "# - Use `reset_index()` if needed to flatten the groupby object for easier readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bonus Task:\n",
    "# After grouping, find the group with the highest average salary and print it.\n"
