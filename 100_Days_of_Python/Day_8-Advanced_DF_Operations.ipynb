    "# Day 8: Advanced DataFrame Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task:\n",
    "# You will work with a DataFrame containing employee details, including their job titles, salaries, and departments.\n",
    "# Your task is to perform various advanced operations on the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here is the data you will work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "# | Name  | Job              | Salary | Department   |\n",
    "# |-------|------------------|--------|--------------|\n",
    "# | John  | Programmer       | 58000  | IT           |\n",
    "# | Eva   | Analyst          | 64000  | Finance      |\n",
    "# | Adam  | Data Scientist   | 72000  | Data Science  |\n",
    "# | Petra | Data Engineer    | 69000  | IT           |\n",
    "# | Mark  | Data Scientist    | 71000  | Data Science  |\n",
    "# | Alex  | Data Analyst      | 62000  | Finance      |\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tasks:\n",
    "# 1. Load the DataFrame with the above data.\n",
    "# 2. Group the DataFrame by 'Department' and calculate the average salary for each department.\n",
    "# 3. Identify the department with the highest average salary and print it.\n",
    "# 4. Create a new column 'Salary Increase' which shows the percentage increase in salary compared to the average salary of their department.\n",
    "# 5. Print the updated DataFrame with the new 'Salary Increase' column.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tips:\n",
    "# - Use `groupby()` to group the DataFrame by department.\n",
    "# - Use `mean()` to calculate average salaries.\n",
    "# - Use `idxmax()` to find the department with the highest average salary.\n",
    "# - Use a formula to calculate percentage increase: `((current_salary - average_salary) / average_salary) * 100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bonus task:\n",
    "# Create a bar chart to visualize the average salary for each department.\n"
