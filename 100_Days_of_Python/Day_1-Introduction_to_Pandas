# Day 1: Introduction to Pandas – Basic DataFrame Operations

# Task:
# Create a Pandas DataFrame from the following data:

# | Name  | Age | Job              | Salary |
# |-------|-----|------------------|--------|
# | John  | 28  | Programmer       | 58000  |
# | Eva   | 34  | Analyst          | 64000  |
# | Adam  | 30  | Data Scientist   | 72000  |
# | Petra | 25  | Data Engineer    | 69000  |

# Tasks:
# 1. Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.
# 2. Sort the DataFrame by salary in descending order.
# 3. Create a new column called "Bonus," which is 10% of each employee’s salary.
# 4. Print only the columns "Name" and "Salary."
# 5. Save the DataFrame to a CSV file.

# Tips:
# - Use the `pandas` library to manipulate the data.
# - You can save the CSV file using the `to_csv()` function.

# Bonus task:
# Find out how many employees have a salary higher than 60,000.
